# Passgenerator
Password Generator
## Key Goals
The purpose of the project is to create a password generator that forms a strong password constucted with letters, numbers and symbols. 
## The Results
The password generator creates a password from predefined user input for the number of letters, numbers and symbols. 
## The Process
Lists are created for upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols.

User input is then collected using the input function for the number of letters, numbers and symbols required in the password. 

A new list is created to contain the password. 

The random module is used to select the characters and then they are added to the new list. 

The list containing the characters for the password is then randomly shuffled. 

The output is a statement containing the password.
